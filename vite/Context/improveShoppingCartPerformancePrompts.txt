Below is a phased approach (three levels) to improve mobile performance and overall efficiency of this cart component. Each phase builds on the previous one. Pick and choose the enhancements that best fit your needs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────

LEVEL 1: QUICK WINS & LOW-HANGING FRUIT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────── These optimizations are straightforward to implement and have minimal risk.
Minimize Re-renders Through useCallbacks & Memos
• You already use memoization (useMemo, useCallback), but review your callbacks and props flows to ensure they are not being re-created unnecessarily.
• Example: The “CartItemCard” and “RecommendationCard” are wrapped with React.memo, which is great. Ensure that the props you pass to them remain stable references.
• If a parent re-renders but the props accept stable references (e.g., unchanged arrays, or callbacks that haven’t changed), your child components won’t re-render.

Eliminate or Gate Heavier Debug Logs in Production
• There are extensive console.logs in the checkout flow (the “detailed cart analysis”). Consider using an environment check to remove or reduce logs in production builds (e.g., NODE_ENV === 'development').
• On mobile devices, heavy console logging can slow JS execution. Using logs only during development helps keep the production version snappy.

Use Suspense or Lazy-Load for Recommended Products
• The recommendedProducts import is immediate. If it’s large or demands many images, consider lazy-loading it or code-splitting.
• For example, load recommended products only when the user opens the cart or when they get near the recommendation area. This reduces initial bundle size and helps with first loads.

Simplify or Defer Animation
• While the animations and transitions look great, additional JS-based transitions (e.g., in the checkout overlay, bounce keyframes on the badge) can add overhead on slower devices.
• Consider deferring or simplifying animations on smaller screens (using a media query or a less complex animation). This ensures that slower CPUs/GPU on mobile aren’t taxed as much.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) LEVEL 2: MORE ADVANCED, STILL MANAGEABLE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These changes are slightly more involved but can yield significant performance improvements.

Virtualize Large Lists (Cart Items, Saved Items)
• If you expect users to add many items to the cart, consider using a library like react-virtualized or react-window.
• These libraries only render what’s visible, which drastically reduces DOM nodes and rendering cost.

Code-Split the Drawer
• If the cart drawer is not used on every visit, you could dynamically import it. For instance, you can lazy-load the entire "CartDrawer" component and only load it when the user clicks the FloatingCartButton.
• This can reduce your initial JavaScript bundle significantly if your cart code is large.

Optimize Image Loading
• Use responsive image sizes or placeholders (like a small Base64) to avoid loading large images on mobile.
• Possibly consider next/image (if using Next.js) or a lightweight library if you’re not on Next. This helps with progressive image loading for a better perceived performance.

Reduce Context Churn by Splitting Context
• Currently, the ShoppingCartContext holds many states. If any part of that context changes, all consumers may re-render.
• Split the context into smaller contexts (e.g., one context purely for cart items, one for UI states like popovers, overlay transitions, etc.) so that re-renders happen more granularly.
• This is more advanced since you must restructure how your context is provided and consumed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) LEVEL 3: HIGH-IMPACT / COMPLEX STRATEGIES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These approaches can massively improve performance but require deeper changes to your build setup or architecture.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Partial SSR / Static Generation
• If your environment allows it (e.g., Next.js or Remix), consider SSR or static generation for parts of the UI.
• This dramatically reduces client-side JS for the initial load, especially beneficial on mobile.
• For the cart itself, you can still hydrate in the browser for interactivity, but SSR can handle the heavy-lifting of rendering recommendedProducts or savedItems.

Intelligent Chunk Splitting & Bundle Analysis
• Run a bundle analyzer (e.g., webpack-bundle-analyzer) to detect large dependencies. Possibly separate MUI icons or each icon into its own chunk since you’re using many @mui/icons-material imports.
• Only import the icons you truly need (tree-shaking). Combining large icons sets can slow down your build.
• You could also use dynamic imports for some Material UI components that are not used on every render (e.g., Popover, Drawer).

Transition to React 18 Concurrent Features / Suspense on Data Fetch
• If you have data fetching from an API, you can adopt React 18’s concurrent mode (with appropriate library support) to reduce blocking UI.
• You can also combine this with Suspense boundaries to chunk your interaction points. For instance, the recommended products can be lazy-loaded with Suspense on hover or scroll.

Advanced Image Optimization & Edge Caching
• If your cart deals with user-specific product images (especially large or numerous images), consider an image CDN or edge caching strategy to reduce time-to-first-byte on mobile.
• Tools like Cloudflare Images, Akamai, Imgix, or an in-house edge solution can drastically improve performance for global users.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Start with Level 1 items to quickly reduce overhead.
• Next, adopt virtualization and code-splitting (Level 2) if you have many cart items or heavier JS.
• Finally, if you’re on a platform like Next.js or are comfortable with advanced configs, consider implementing SSR, thorough bundle analysis, and concurrency (Level 3).

By tackling improvements incrementally, you can measure their actual impact in production and find the right balance of complexity vs. performance gains.
