Customer Dashboard for ML/LLM Plugin Management
To complement the developer marketplace, here's a detailed description of the customer dashboard that organizations need to manage their purchased ML/LLM plugins:
1. Plugin Portfolio & Management

Installed Plugins Overview: Grid/list view of all active plugins with real-time status indicators

Health status badges: üü¢ Healthy, üü° Degraded, üî¥ Down, ‚ö° Rate Limited
Quick metrics: Current RPS, latency, error rate, monthly usage %
One-click access to plugin settings, logs, and analytics
Bulk actions: Enable/disable multiple plugins, export configurations


Plugin Workspaces: Organize plugins by project/department

Create isolated workspaces with separate billing and access controls
Workspace templates for common use cases (e.g., "Customer Support Suite")
Cross-workspace plugin sharing with permission controls
Workspace-level spending limits and alerts



2. Real-time Usage Analytics & Cost Management

Unified Analytics Dashboard:

Live request feed with filtering by plugin, endpoint, status code
Heatmap visualization of usage patterns across time zones
Cost burn rate with predictive monthly spending
Performance benchmarking against similar organizations


Budget Controls & Alerts:

Set spending limits per plugin, workspace, or globally
Automated plugin throttling when approaching limits
Email/SMS/Slack alerts for usage anomalies
Cost allocation tags for internal chargebacks


Advanced Metrics:

P50/P95/P99 latency breakdowns per plugin
Token usage for LLM plugins with cost per token
Geographic distribution of API calls
Failed request analysis with error categorization



3. API Gateway & Integration Hub

Unified API Management:

Single API gateway endpoint: https://api.your-company.plugins.ai
Automatic request routing to appropriate plugin versions
Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
Request/response transformation and enrichment


Developer Experience Tools:

Interactive API playground with real plugin responses
Auto-generated SDKs in 10+ languages
Postman/Insomnia collections for each plugin
GraphQL wrapper for REST plugins


Integration Patterns:
javascript// Example unified client
const plugins = new PluginClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  workspace: 'production'
});

// Automatic load balancing and failover
const result = await plugins.codeReview.analyze({
  repository: 'github.com/company/repo',
  pullRequest: 123
});


4. Team Management & RBAC

Granular Permission System:

Roles: Admin, Developer, Analyst, Billing, Read-only
Plugin-specific permissions (e.g., "Can use GPT-4 plugins")
API key scoping by IP, domain, or time window
SSO integration with SAML/OAuth providers


Audit & Compliance:

Complete audit trail of all API calls with request/response bodies
GDPR-compliant data retention policies
SOC 2 compliance reports per plugin
Export audit logs to SIEM systems



5. White-Label & Customization

Enterprise Branding:

Custom domain mapping: ai.your-company.com
Branded API documentation portals
Custom plugin UI themes matching corporate design
Remove vendor branding for white-label plugins


Configuration Management:

Priority support for enterprise customers
Shared Slack channels with dev teams
Video call scheduling for complex issues


Knowledge Base:

Plugin-specific documentation
Customer-contributed recipes and patterns
Video tutorials and webinars

This customer dashboard complements the developer marketplace by providing enterprises with the tools they need to effectively manage, monitor, and scale their AI/ML plugin usage while maintaining security, compliance, and cost control.RetryGBdoes this work for individual users also? cause i have a shopping cart where they can browse and buyEditReimagined dashboard design for individual and enterprise users.4sThe user is asking if the customer dashboard I described would work for individual users, mentioning they have a shopping cart where users can browse and buy. The dashboard I described was very enterprise-focused with features like:

Workspaces
Team management/RBAC
SSO integration
Audit logs
Invoice consolidation
Enterprise compliance

This would be overwhelming and inappropriate for individual users who just want to browse, buy, and use plugins. Individual users need a much simpler, consumer-friendly experience. Let me provide a better solution that works for both individual users AND enterprises, with different tiers/views based on user type.Great point! The dashboard I described is heavily enterprise-focused and would be overwhelming for individual users. Let me redesign it to support both individual users and enterprises with a tiered approach:
Unified Customer Dashboard - Individual & Enterprise
Individual User Experience (B2C)

Progressive Enhancement to Business
As users grow, they can upgrade to business features:
4. Tier System
javascriptconst accountTiers = {
  PERSONAL: {
    price: '$9/mo',
    features: [
      '3 active plugins',
      '10k API calls/mo',
      'Email support',
      'Basic analytics'
    ]
  },
  PRO: {
    price: '$49/mo',
    features: [
      '10 active plugins',
      '100k API calls/mo',
      'Priority support',
      'Advanced analytics',
      'API key management',
      'Webhook support'
    ]
  },
  TEAM: {
    price: '$199/mo',
    features: [
      'Unlimited plugins',
      '1M API calls/mo',
      '5 team members',

      'SSO',
      'SLA'
    ]
  },
  ENTERPRISE: {
    // Full dashboard as previously described
  }
}
Smart UI Adaptation
The dashboard adapts based on user type:
javascript// Dashboard component that adapts to user tier
export default function Dashboard() {
  const { user, tier } = useAuth();
  
  if (tier === 'PERSONAL') {
    return <PersonalDashboard />; // Simple, clean, focused
  }
  
  if (tier === 'PRO') {
    return <ProDashboard />;  // More metrics, API management
  }
  
  if (tier === 'TEAM') {
    return <TeamDashboard />; // Add collaboration features
  }
  
  return <EnterpriseDashboard />; // Full feature set
}
